/*
 * TODO:
 * 2. Ideally, TicketShell should be splitted from ObjectShell (create a new class)
 * 3. Ideally, remove Ticket- prefix from generic classes
 * 5. Move LoadCommand to the shell
 * 6. Replace Scanner with BufferedInputStream (hasNext has strange consequences in shell's interactive behaviour)
 * 7. FEATURE: support of Unicode.
 * 8. Existance of BeanDeserializer?
